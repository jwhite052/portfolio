# Overview
A private high school based out in Colorado needed a modern, user-friendly website that would support their new enrollment initiatives. The new site would offer a sleek design and an improved user experience. The refresh was to attract prospective students and keep current students engaged and informed. The site's structure and navigation was reorganized with attention to keeping content concise and actionable. Features like page section navigation and primary navigation with megamenu style dropdowns allow for quick and easy access to both important and deeper level content.
