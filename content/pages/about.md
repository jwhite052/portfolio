I'm a developer and designer actively pursuing my passion to provide digital design and development services. When not working, I enjoy hiking, biking, kayaking, film, robotics, and exploring all the amazing shops, food, breweries, music venues and activities Philadelphia has to offer.

Currently, I am a full-time Front-End Web Developer for Thomas Jefferson University Hospital &ndash; a major medical university and healthcare provider in Philadelphia. Some of my responsibilities include: developing responsive web pages and components with a focus on user experience, designing templates for various departments and campaign sites, maintaining content, troubleshooting bugs, e-mail marketing, and developing for the front-end development side of our CMS, Adobe Experience Manager (AEM).

I graduated from Penn State University in 2011 with a degree in computer engineering. I landed my first programming position at a direct mailing company as a data programming analyst &ndash; responsible for building out custom templates and applications for automating the creation, processing, and printing of patient invoice statements. After 3 years I recognized it was time for a change. I wanted to work with more innovative and industry leading technologies. I shifted focus and decided to pursue the path of a web developer. I had been freelance graphics designing and providing web design and development services on and off throughout high school and college. Recognizing the opportunity to work with amazing technologies in a rapidly expanding industry and community gave me the push to pursue my passion full-time. Haven't looked back since and enjoy the challenging, creativity-tasking environment, and unlimited opportunity it provides.

I primarily work with building out responsive and user friendly web components and web sites. I plan to continue to grow as a web developer &ndash; providing custom web application and website solutions with an emphasis on an enjoyable yet simple user experience.
