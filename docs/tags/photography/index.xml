      <description>Overview Sylvain came to me with a vision of his site&amp;rsquo;s redesign. After being left-behind and disatisfied by his previous developer, he counted on me to get things right. I decided WordPress was the way to go - allowing him to maintain and make updates as needed. The clean and visual site structure allows viewers to truly appreciate and experience his amazing photography. The responsive design and intuitive navigation invites users to explore all that Sylvain has to offer.</description>
